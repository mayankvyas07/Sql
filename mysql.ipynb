    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of structured data that is stored and managed for various purposes, such as retrieving, updating, and analyzing information. Databases provide a way to store, organize, and manage data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that use a schema to define the structure of the data and the relationships between different tables. They use a tabular format to store data and rely on a predefined schema. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are non-relational databases that store and retrieve data in various formats, such as key-value pairs, documents, column-family, and graphs. They are more flexible than SQL databases and are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "DDL (Data Definition Language) is a subset of SQL used to define and manage the structure of a database and its objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE: Used to create new database objects like tables, indexes, and views.\n",
    "Example: CREATE TABLE Students (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50), age INT);\n",
    "DROP: Used to delete existing database objects.\n",
    "Example: DROP TABLE Students;\n",
    "ALTER: Used to modify existing database objects, like adding or removing columns.\n",
    "Example: ALTER TABLE Students ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(100);\n",
    "TRUNCATE: Used to remove all records from a table while keeping the table structure intact.\n",
    "Example: TRUNCATE TABLE Students;\n",
    "Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "DML (Data Manipulation Language) is a subset of SQL used to manage the data stored within a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT: Used to add new records into a table.\n",
    "Example: INSERT INTO Students (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'John', 25);\n",
    "UPDATE: Used to modify existing records in a table.\n",
    "Example: UPDATE Students SET age = 26 WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "DELETE: Used to remove records from a table.\n",
    "Example: DELETE FROM Students WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "DQL (Data Query Language) is a subset of SQL used to retrieve data from a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT: Used to retrieve data from one or more tables.\n",
    "Example: SELECT * FROM Students WHERE age > 20;\n",
    "Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Key: A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table. It ensures that each row is uniquely identifiable and helps maintain data integrity. A table can have only one primary key.\n",
    "Foreign Key: A foreign key is a field in a table that is used to establish a link between two tables. It references the primary key of another table, creating a relationship between them. It enforces referential integrity and maintains the relationships between tables.\n",
    "Q6. Write a Python code to connect MySQL to Python. Explain the cursor() and execute() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of connecting to a MySQL database using Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "import mysql.connector\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to the database\n",
    "db_connection = mysql.connector.connect(\n",
    "    host=\"localhost\",\n",
    "    user=\"username\",\n",
    "    password=\"password\",\n",
    "    database=\"mydatabase\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a cursor\n",
    "cursor = db_connection.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Execute an SQL query\n",
    "query = \"SELECT * FROM Students;\"\n",
    "cursor.execute(query)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetch the results\n",
    "results = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "for row in results:\n",
    "    print(row)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the cursor and connection\n",
    "cursor.close()\n",
    "db_connection.close()\n",
    "Cursor: A cursor is an object that allows you to interact with the database. It acts as a pointer to a specific location in the result set. You can use it to execute SQL queries and retrieve data.\n",
    "Execute: The execute() method of the cursor is used to execute SQL queries. It takes an SQL query as an argument and sends it to the database for execution. After executing a query, you can retrieve the results using methods like fetchone(), fetchall(), etc.\n",
    "Q7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical order of execution for SQL clauses in a query is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "FROM: Specifies the tables from which data will be retrieved.\n",
    "WHERE: Filters the rows based on specified conditions.\n",
    "GROUP BY: Groups the rows based on specified columns.\n",
    "HAVING: Filters the grouped rows based on conditions.\n",
    "SELECT: Specifies the columns to be retrieved.\n",
    "ORDER BY: Sorts the result set based on specified columns.\n",
    "LIMIT/OFFSET: Limits the number of rows returned (used for pagination).\n",
    "It's important to note that not all clauses are required in every query, and the order might vary depending on the specific query's requirements."
